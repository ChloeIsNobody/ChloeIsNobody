Hi, I'm Chloe (she/her)! I'm a college student studying Game Development, and I make datapack addons for the Minecraft mod "Origins".
I've created datapacks such as Reworked Origins, Better Enderian, Enderian Silk Touch Hands, the Bloomling Origin, the Froglin Origin, the Iron Golem Origin, etc.
I've also contributed to MGZ's Origin Creator.
If you have a question about or an issue with one of my datapacks, or you just want to chat, dm's are always open @Nobody#0836 on Discord!
